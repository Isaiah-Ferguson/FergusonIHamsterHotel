Good job on the desktop site. Most of it is on point and very close to the prototype. In "Laptop L" view mode most things pass the quick eye test. There is however a little bit of overlap problem in the packages area but it only seems to affect that specific view mode. "Tablet" mode is on point. Really good job with the responsiveness on that. On the coding side I'm super impressed you were able to that with just the built-in bootstrap display property classes. Really good design choice in making your own horizontal cards for the rooms area.
For Mobile responsiveness the "iPhone 12 Pro" view mode is also pretty awesome. Really love the design choice and execution in the Reservation area. That form fields line up and look great vertically stacked like that. The packages area also stacks very nicely for mobile- great job getting the picture to be offset in two column views but on top of the text in single column views. Good design choice to get rid of the amenities icons for mobile to make it short, sweet, and informative. But the wall of text is a bit hard on the eyes. A little bit better spacing there would help a ton.
Code is pretty clean and easy to follow/read for both the html and css. Great use of comments in the html to make it clear how each block of code relates to a specific section of the code. On the css side great use of properties we haven't covered yet and getting the on-hover to work properly. One suggestion I'll offer for the future is instead of naming classes "hero-img-1" and "container1" maybe name them "ov-hero-img" and "ov-container" just so the class names also have a bit of symantic meaning. It'll make things much easier to follow in the long run if you ever have to come back to this project months from now.
Overall great work on both the main page and the responsive modes! The project has come a long way since I originally pulled it down, good work on ironing out most of my initial nitpicks. I can tell being able to take feedback constructively is already one of your strengths. That combo of good soft skills and coding skills is gonna take you places for sure. Good work!
